<h6> Git Subsystem is comprised of *Index(stagin),*Head,*WorkingDirectory. </h6>

<p>See tree contents:
<br>git ls-tree -r &lt;branchname&gt; </p>


<p>git-ls-files - Show information about files in the index and the working tree <br></p>

<p>change to branch
git checkout (branchname) <br></p>
<p>delete the branch:
git branch -d feature_x <br></p>
<p>TO COMMIT THEM:
git commit -m "Commit message"
(now it is in HEAD, but not in remote repository(main area)
<br></p>
<p>TO propose changes (add it to the Index) use:
git add &lt;filename&gt;
git add *
<br></p>
<h6>PUSHING files:</h6>
<p>git push origin master
(where MASTER=whatever branch you want to push your changes to.)
<br>
<br></p>
<p>???
If you have not cloned an existing repository and want to connect your repository to a remote server, you need to add it with
git remote add origin &lt;server&gt;
Now you are able to push your changes to the selected remote server
<br>
create a working copy local repo:
git clone /path/to/repository
<br>
REmote copy:
it clone username@host:/path/to/repository
<br></p>
